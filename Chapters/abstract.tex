This project presents functional encryption using attribute-based and identity-based encryption as examples. The term functional key exchange is presented including \gls{abake} and \gls{ibake}, these schemes are described with possible application areas discussed. 
\par The project also introduce another \gls{abake} scheme based on functional encryption, this is implemented in a distributed chat system. The system shows how functional key exchange can be utilized in real world applications to exchange keys and thus communicate securely, this without revealing the identities of the users. The system is constructed with the privacy of the users in mind, the access control is based on user attributes - characteristics describing who the user is. These attributes are used to build access trees regulating who is allowed to take part in the communication. 
\par The system demonstrated shows how such a system looks and demonstrates how new session keys are computed every time a new user joins the chat room, as well as how the users and intermediate server interacts throughout the life cycle of the clients.
