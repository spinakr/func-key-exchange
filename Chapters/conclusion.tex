\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}
This project have presented, described and compared different functional key exchange mechanisms and showed how they can be used in different scenarios. In addition to researching the concepts of \gls{abake} and \gls{ibake}and how these schemes are constructed, an actual application taking advantages of \gls{abake} are presented with models and a demonstration. The application described uses \gls{abe} as the encapsulation mechanism so that each user can provide their own contribution, thus achieving old encapsulation secrecy - assuring that a set of compromised old encapsulations will not reveal the new session key. The system provides mutual authentication since only users with the correct attributes can obtain all the required symmetric keys to compute the session key.
